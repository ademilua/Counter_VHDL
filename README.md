# Counter_VHDL
The aim of this project is to implement a counter that would enable counting for one clock cycle each time a push button is pressed and display the value on LEDs in binary form.

Background
Here we have to filter input signals with both debouncing and edge detector since the contacts of any mechanical button to convert any analogy push to 1’s and 0’s passes through a bouncing effect (bouncing provides several transitions state before performing the main task) meanwhile the process of removing this bouncing effect is important as to get accurate result.
